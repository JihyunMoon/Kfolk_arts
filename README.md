About : Investigate and visualize Korean Folk culture and arts

About me : Hello, this is a research paper and research data repository. I am currently pursuing a PhD at Seoul National University.
The goal of my PhD at Seoul National University is to deeply explore the intersection of AI and human language to shape the next-generation design paradigm.
I am interested in Korean folk culture and art, especially visual language data analysis of Korean cultural heritage.
I will establish and manage additional research plans on GitHub.
